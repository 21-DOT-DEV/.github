This organization is the new home for swift-secp256k1 (previously known as secp256k1.swift).

Although things might appear sparse at the moment, we are actively renaming our libraries to better adhere to [assumed package standards](https://forums.swift.org/t/what-exactly-is-the-real-name-of-this-package/64868) and transferring some repositories from their current locations. These changes are intended to provide a more stable developer experience moving forward and minimize potential disruptions.
